# 3D Printable Mannequin Head (Zed Mini)
These files can be 3D printed to build an humanoid head which uses the ZED mini stereo camera as eyes. The Zed mini baseline is 63mm which is coherent with the average human eyes baseline.

The mannequin is composed by 5 parts, and fits most commercially available FDM 3D printers (approximately 20x20x15cm volume required):
- HeadBottom is the lower half of the head. Prints with the neck on the build plate on FDM printers, it will not fit into smaller SLA/mSLA printers. This is the longest print. If it doesn't fit inside the build plate, rotate on the diagonal (rotated 45Â° on the Z axis). Requires supports for the camera housing. The camera housing is open on the left side to be able to connect the ZED cable.

- HeadTop is the skull. It has been separated from the bottom part for two reasons: to fit inside smaller printers build volume and to be able to swap the top of the skull with other shapes if needed (e.g. with a Vive Tracker stand). It is connected to the base with two JunctionPins. Prints without supports as there arer only two small bridging sections for the pins, and the pins are slightly shorter to compensate any sagging. If unsure on your printer bridging capabilities, print with supports inside the holes and they should easily be removable with pliers.

- JunctionPins (2 required). Are used to connect the top and bottom part of the mannequin.

- Camera cover. Encloses the ZED mini stereo camera inside the mannequin. small magnets can be glued to keep the camera in place.


All the parts can be printed in PLA/ABS at 0.2mm layer height with a 0.4mm nozzle. If you want to weight down the mannequin, either use an high infill percentage or use a coarse gyroid infill and later fill with epoxy/sand the HeadTop/HeadBottom parts. 2-3 perimeter walls are advised.
