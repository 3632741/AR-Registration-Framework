# Led Box
Arduino project and 3D printable box.
For the project, we used an Arduino Uno with an Arduino prototyping shield. The other components are an IR receiver, a green LED and a resistor. The image below display the general wiring. If the given code is used, the LED must be wired to I/O pin number 7 (yellow cable) and the IR receiver to the I/O pin number 11 (green cable).
